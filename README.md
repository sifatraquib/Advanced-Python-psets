# Advanced-Python-psets

In this course, we will examine a range of advanced techniques for improving the performance of Python programs, including the use of parallel computation and GPU acceleration. We will also investigate how Python can be used for big data analysis using frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. Students will have the opportunity to employ these techniques and gain hands-on experience developing advanced Python applications.
